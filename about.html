<p>I'm a writer and programmer working at the Hesburgh Libraries of the University of Notre Dame. I know Python, HTML5, and CSS3, with a lot more to come. I'm currently learning full stack web development through Flatiron School, and I possess and MFA in Creative Writing as well as a Masters of Library and Information Science from Simmons College where I majored in Information Science and Technology. The title of this blog comes from the novel A Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The eponymous book contains everything you need to traverse the galaxy, whether or not its helpful, its thorough, and of course, always interesting.</p>
