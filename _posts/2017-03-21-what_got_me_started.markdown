I should start by introducing myself. The best introduction I could think of was "Call me, Andrew," but since I am neither a shipmate on the *Pequod* nor the narrator of a really boring novel, I'll skip it!

The name's Andrew, and aside from being a "digital native" like most 90's kids, my knowledge of programming was pretty lacking until I hit college. I studied English literature in undergrad, something I don't regret, although it was hardly useful in the real world after graduation. Naturally a degree in English landed me a job in a library. That's when I discovered programming.

Not gonna lie, it felt kinda like this clip from *War Games* (I warned you about 80's!). The library I worked for had encouraged me to get a Masters in Library Science. I know what you're thinking and yes, librarians need masters degrees. Also, yes, I've been asked this way too many times. This degree offered a few programming courses and one in Web Development. I took all of them!

There was a certain satisfaction from plugging code into the terminal or designing a web page in the browswer and seeing it appear on the screen, and I wanted more and more to make that my life. Let's just say answering reference questions didn't sound appealing when I could make CLI applications and interactive websites. However, when I finished all that I knew I still only carried a beginner's knowledge of coding, which is what brought me to enrolling in Flatiron School's Full Stack Web Development program.

The whole point of this post was to tell you why I'm making this change, getting out of libraries and into coding, and it's pretty simple: I love code. 
* Being an English major and lover of languages it all worked with me on one level because it was like learning new grammar and syntax, how it all worked together. 
* It's also far more logical than anything I've worked with before. Literature and lit papers are vague, and the deeper meanings of books can be made up on the spot a lot of the time. But with programming everything you plug in (without errors, of course!) will always return how its expected to run. 
* Finally, while there's this static concept that one piece of code will always do the same thing, there is ample if not infitine posibilities and combinations for your code, allowing the creation of new things all the time.

I can't see my life without programming now. It's become a part of my life like eating, sleeping, working out, or watching 80's movies. And it's how I want it to be. Plain and simple.
